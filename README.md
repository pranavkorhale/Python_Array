<h1> Python_Array</h1>
<h2>Has everything about arrays like creation, indexing, slicing, Data type etc.</h2>
<p>To work with arrays in python <b>NumPy</b> library is used, NumPy means Numerical Python.<br>
<p>It is an open source library and mainly used for the scientific calculation and Data manipulation in python. It is use extensively in Data Science.</p>
<p><i>It helps us to use multi-dimensional array and matrices</i>. Array object in numpy is called <b>ndarray</b>(n-dimensional array).</p>
<p>List is there in python which kinnda works like array but not exactly.So what is different about arrays-<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arrays can be <i>5 to 30 times</i> faster than the list for various operations.</li>
      <li>It is faster because <i>Arrays</i> are densely packed in homogeneous locations (means contiguous memory locations one after the other) unlike list it has scattered memory lactions.</li> 
      <li>This behaviour in computing is called <b>locality of reference.</b></li>
    </ul>
<p>NumPy library is partially written in python but most things that require fast computation are written in c or c++.</p> 
<h3>How to start off-</h3>
1) First install NumPy library using your command prompt-<br>
    <ul><li>For windows- pip install numpy or pip3 install numpy</li>
    <li>For ubuntu - sudo apt install python-numpy</li></ul><br>
2) Don't forget to import the file using <b>import numpy</b>
